Readme for dscsim, Version X.X.X
======================================

This is dscsim, Version X.X.X

Please visit http://dscsim.sourceforge.net for latest
information about dscsim.

For licensing information see file License.txt and the
licenses of the bundled libraries in directory "legal".

==================================================
New in dscsim X.X.X:
- Separate Installation Guide (PDF, only German) will be installed
  with Pack "Advanced and Administrative Options". The document is
  intended to be given away to students.
- HTML-List generated by Orga-Tool now also contains Setup-String
  for "Bremen Rescue" 
- AIRWAVE is now the default provider protocol
- dscsim will now determine from the MMSI if the station is a ship station
  or a shore station. ([1655493] Enable simulation of a coast station)
- Package "Advanced and Administrative Options" now creates a separate
  shortcut to start dscsim with a second configuration (intended for
  shore station)
New in dscsim 1.3.0:
- New "Orga" tool to generate create HTML pages with setup information 
- Additional windows shortcut to this file
- when the main class DscsimStarter is started it is now possible to
  set an alternative log4j.properties file via system property
  "log4j.configFile". This feature is used for the "nucleus version".
  The nucleus by default uses a specific logging config file named
  "log4j.nucleus.properties"
- added a third window which contains status information
  - MMSI
  - name of station (might be set via startup parameter "dscsim.station_name"
  - call sign (might be set via startup parameter "dscsim.call_sign"
  - status bar indicating the status of the network connection
    (colors red, yellow, blue, green)
- cleaning up internal resources if a remote airwave can not be reached
  for some time (necessary for long running server processes to avoid
  memory leak)
- change in internal processing which reduces system load when radio
  is not transmitting
- new (optional) configuration parameters for the UDP-Airwave:
   dscsim.udp_airwave.startport: the preferred UDP port to use 
    (default: 37534)
   dscsim.udp_airwave.portcount: the given number of subsequent ports which might
     be used (default: 10)
   dscsim.udp_airwave.magicnumber: the magic number of the packet header
     (default: 369876138)
- Fixed bug "[1655507] audio stream in radio sometimes not terminating"
- Implemented an 'Airwave Nucleus' mode which only starts up an "Airwave" 
  without any radio or controler GUI. This process might be used - when
  started on a network server - to serve as a 'condensation point' for 
  establishing the P2P network.
  The start script and a starter icon (on windows) will be installed if
  the (new) installation package 'Advanced and Administrative Options' is
  selected. (this implements '[1655496] dscsim daemon mode')
- Removed obsolete use of ActiveMQ as transport layer
- Radio now might be switched on and off (note yet the controller)
  (part of [1655495] Implement/simulate behavior of on/off switch)
- Size of Transmit button in Radio GUI increases
- Radio GUI frame no longer resizable. 
  ([1655485] Buttons disapear when making the radio window too small)
- Squelch level now initially set to 3; prevents noise when starting
  up. ([1655482] Squelch should be preset to higher level)
New in dscsim 1.2.2:
- Fixed a bug in the P2P protocol which under some conditions
  prevented reconnect after restarting a station
New in dscsim 1.2.1:
- started with writing a user guide (not really useful yet)
- auto adjust of microphone amplifier
- initial level of sound volume decreased (avoid loud noise when starting)
- keyboard mnemonics for radio part
- ability to simply press ENTER to transmit when radio window is focussed
- tooltip texts for radio part

- platform independent installer (based on IzPack)
- several bugfixes
